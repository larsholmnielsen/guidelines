An authoritative `list of projects <http://api.openaire.eu/oai_pmh?verb=ListRecords&set=projects&metadataPrefix=oaf>`_ is exposed by OpenAIRE through OAI-PMH, and available for all repository managers. Values include the project name and project ID. The projectID equals the Grant Agreement identifier, and is defined by the `info:eu-repo namespace <http://purl.org/eu-repo/semantics/#info-eu-repo-GrantAgreementIdentifiers>`_ term grantAgreement.

The syntax is::

   info:eu-repo/grantAgreement/Funder/FundingProgram/ProjectID/
   [Jurisdiction]/[ProjectName]/[ProjectAcronym]

where:

* ``Funder`` refers to the funding organization (e.g., ``EC`` for European Commission, ``WT`` for Wellcome Trust)
* ``FundingProgramme`` refers to a specific programme (e.g., ``FP7``)
* ``ProjectID`` refers to a unique identifier in the scope of the funder (and maybe the programme), e.g. a grant agreement number.
* ``Jurisdiction`` refers to the authority granted to a formally constituted legal body (e.g. ``EU`` for European Union)
* ``ProjectName`` contains the full name of the project
* ``ProjectAcronym`` contains the projectâ€™s acronym.

For OpenAIRE compatibility, the elements in square brackets are optional. Repositories may choose to use the old three-part namespace (``info:eu-repo/grantAgreement/Funder/FundingProgram/ProjectID``) as specified in previous versions of the Guidelines, or use the extended version with six parts, which is recommended.

.. FIXME For OpenAIRE compatibility, the elements in square brackets are optional. Repositories may choose to use only the old three-part namespace (info:eu-repo/grantAgreement/Funder/FundingProgram/ProjectID), or use the extended version with six parts.

When omitting fields in the extended version, the number of fields must be preserved by using ``/``. A correct example for omitting the the ``ProjectName`` field would therefore look like this: ``EC/FP7/12345/EU//OpenAIREplus``

If any of the field values contains a forward slash (``/``), it needs to be escaped using URL encoding (``%2F``). For instance, ``My/Project`` would be represented as ``My%2FProject``.
